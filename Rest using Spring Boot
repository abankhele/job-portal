Now we are losing jsp pages and using react and we are introducing react
Json data will be passed from frontend to backend and vice versa through API

REST(Representational State Transfer)

server(resource)
job, user, admin, employer - entity
state(current state of the data) is sent to the client
Stateless- A communication method in which server completes every client request independently of all previous requests.
(who you are why you are asking every time)

in urls use nouns
/jobs, /job
methods will change (get, post, update, delete)

Xml is also used to send/recive the data but xml is old and json uses less memory.

HTTP method: (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
Get : read data (GetMapping)
Post : create data (PostMapping)
put : update data (PutMapping)
delete: delete data (DeleteMapping)

by default we have get on browser 

for post and other request we use postman

Understanding the React UI

To connect to React frontend all we have to do is make changes in the Controller 
1. Change @Controller to @RestController
2. We are sending jsp pages before now we have to send json data
3. change the return type from string to whatever the type is
4. @GetMapping("jobPosts") we decide the endpoint of the backend
5. Cross orgin error is resolved by @CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000/")
